Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room desires a web-based game that can serve multiple platforms based on their current Android game, Draw It or Lose It. This game aims to have various teams consisting of several people going four rounds of a minute each. When a picture is shown from a library of images, one team guesses till time runs out. If not answered, each opposing team member gets to answer till 15 seconds run out.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
There was a clear understanding of the client’s requirements. Therefore, the suggestions on architecture, design, OS, development, security, and storage directly addressed their issues and answered each requirement. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Taking each section at a time ensured that the questions were answered correctly and within the scope of the requirements. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The additional commenting on the code as sometimes I needed to be more detailed. This will make it difficult for future developers and enablement of functionality. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
There is an old adage that developers should wait to test their code as they know how to make it pass every time. However, allowing users to b part of the journey ensures that the customers' needs are met along with edge cases that were not the “correct path” tested by a developer. 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Designing software is about listening to the customer, looking to the future, and ensuring that code is scalable in both usage and security, as well as documentation. With all of these in mind, you will succeed in your software development.
